An unsupervised clustering model will then be created, with the aim of creating multiple distinct segments of companies based on their activity which can help provide actionable insight into the expected behaviors of a company based on their on the URLs which they visit. 

## Project Setup

The full project is captured as part of Jupyter notebook. Upload the following files into a Jupyter notebook order to step through:
- Capstone_Development_1.ipynb
- sample_model_data_protected_60k.csv (ISSUES Uploading, select sampleMode=1)
- sample_model_data_protected_small5k.csv
- visuals.py

A protected version of the code used to derive the datasets above can be also be viewed from a  Jupyter notebook:
- Base Data Creation - Safe.ipynb
- Creating Derived Dataset - Safe.ipynb
